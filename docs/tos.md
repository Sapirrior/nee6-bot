**2. Description of Service**

Nee6 is an AI-powered Discord bot designed to help server administrators manage link sharing within their communities.  It offers AI-driven link detection and filtering to prevent spam, malicious links, and inappropriate content.  Currently, Nee6 operates on a simple enable/disable model via the "Manage Messages" permission. Future development may include customizable whitelists/blacklists and other granular controls.

**3. User Responsibilities**

*   You are responsible for ensuring that your use of Nee6 complies with Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
*   You agree not to use Nee6 for any illegal or harmful purposes.
*   You are responsible for managing the "Manage Messages" permission for the Nee6 bot's highest role.  Granting this permission enables the bot's link-blocking functionality, and revoking it disables it.
*   You understand that the AI-powered link detection is under continuous development and may not be perfect. While Nee6 strives to minimize false positives, some legitimate links may be flagged.
*   You agree not to attempt to circumvent Nee6's link filtering mechanisms.
