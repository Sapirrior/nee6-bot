# Nee6 Discord Bot - Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how the Nee6 Discord bot ("Nee6," "we," "us," or "our") handles data within your Discord server.  We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

**1. Information We Collect**

Nee6's core functionality revolves around analyzing links posted within your Discord server to determine if they comply with your server's rules (via the "Manage Messages" permission).  To achieve this, Nee6 processes the following information:

*   **Link Content:** When a user posts a link in a channel where Nee6 is active, the bot analyzes the URL and surrounding text to assess its safety and appropriateness.  This analysis is performed in real-time.

**2. Information We Do Not Collect**

Nee6 does *not* collect the following types of information:

*   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** We do not collect your name, Discord user ID (except temporarily during link analysis), email address, IP address, or any other information that could directly identify you.
*   **User Messages (Except Links):**  Nee6 only processes messages that contain links. We do not store or analyze the content of other messages.
*   **Server Data Beyond Links:**  We do not collect information about your Discord server beyond the links posted within it.  This includes, but is not limited to, member lists, channel names, or other server settings.

**3. How We Use the Information**

The information Nee6 collects (link content) is used solely for the purpose of:

*   **Link Filtering:**  Analyzing links to determine if they should be allowed based on the "Manage Messages" permission.  This is the primary function of the bot.
*   **Improving the Bot:**  Aggregated, anonymized data about link types (e.g., prevalence of certain domains) may be used to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of Nee6's link detection algorithms.  This data will *not* be linked back to individual users or servers.

**4. Data Sharing**

We do not share any user or server data with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:

*   **Legal Compliance:** If required by law, we may disclose information to comply with a legal obligation or request.
*   **Service Providers:** We may engage third-party service providers to assist with the operation of Nee6 (e.g., hosting).  These providers will be contractually obligated to protect your data and only use it for the purposes we specify.

**5. Data Retention**

Link content is only processed in real-time for the purpose of link filtering. We do not retain or store this data beyond what is necessary for immediate analysis.  Aggregated, anonymized data used for bot improvement will be kept only as long as necessary for that purpose.

**6. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Any changes will be posted on this document.  Your continued use of Nee6 following the posting of such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
